🎬 Netflix Data Analysis (EDA Project)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to uncover patterns and insights about content types, categories, countries, and ratings.
It’s part of my self-learning journey into the world of Data Analysis — turning raw data into stories that make sense.

NumPy — Numerical operations


🚀 About the Project

I started learning Data Analysis just two months ago, and this project reflects my early progress.
It’s not a professional or paid work — it’s a milestone in my journey toward becoming a skilled Data Analyst.
Every visualization, every line of code here, represents curiosity, persistence, and a deep passion for learning.

⭐ Future Improvements

Add interactive dashboards (using Plotly or Power BI)

Apply Machine Learning models to predict content popularity

Create automated reports using Python scripts
